# Sample Project Structure

This project demonstrates a sample structure where:

- **Authentication** is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **UI Components** are designed using the Material-UI (MUI) library.
- **API Calls** are handled with Axios.
- **State Management** is facilitated by the Context API.

## Key Technologies

- **JWT**: Secure user authentication and session management.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For building an elegant and responsive user interface.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to interact with the backend.
- **Context API**: For managing application state effectively across components.

This structure is flexible, scalable, and follows modern best practices for web application development.
